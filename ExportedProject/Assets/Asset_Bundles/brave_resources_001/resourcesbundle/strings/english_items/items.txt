#AWP_LONGDESC
An extremely powerful rifle. Banned in some sectors, its ease of use caused it to be the weapon of choice for thousands of unskilled marksmen.

Trank Gun
#BARETTA_SHORTDESC

Sling
#SLING_SHORTDESC
Outrageous!
#SLING_LONGDESC
Sometimes the old ways are the best ways. Deals more damage to powerful foes.

Dart Gun
#DARTGUN_SHORTDESC
Sticky

Dueling Pistol
#DUELINGPISTOL_SHORTDESC
Ricochet

Old Goldie
#GOLDDOUBLEBARRELSHOTGUN_SHORTDESC
For The Discerning
#GOLDDOUBLEBARRELSHOTGUN_LONGDESC
A masterwork shotgun.

H4mmer

#BLOOPER_ENCNAME
Blooper
#BLOOPER_SHORTDESC
Close Your Bloop
#BLOOPER_LONGDESC
Extremely high knockback.

M1
#M1RIFLE_SHORTDESC
Bolt Action
#M1RIFLE_LONGDESC

Makarov
#MAKAROV_SHORTDESC
The People's Gun

Megahand
#LEMONHANDCANNON_SHORTDESC
-P-
#LEMONHANDCANNON_LONGDESC

Lightning In A Bullet
#PLASMARIFLE_LONGDESC

This Budget Revolver was brought to the Gungeon by an infamous fugitive. 

Provided by the Hegemony Regional Magistrate. The Convict won their plea to face the Gungeon in lieu of life imprisonment; undo their crimes, or face an eternity in Gungeon. With no cost to the state, it was an acceptable arrangement.

So specific were his descriptions of individual performances that the historian was compelled to use several pages to describe the audience’s adoration at a single song. Apparently that Gungeoneer also killed a king, and had sought the Gun to undo that act. The details of that story, however, were never recorded, as the historian had run out of ink.
