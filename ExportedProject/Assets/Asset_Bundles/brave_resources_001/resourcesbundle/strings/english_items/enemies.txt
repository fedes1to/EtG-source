This mysterious Gungeon menace styles himself "The Resourceful Rat," and is surely the biggest annoyance the Gungeon has ever seen.

Living for the spite of Gungeoneers, and thriving by stealing their loot, this rat has accumulated a hoard of Gungeon artifacts.

Having made a home for himself below the Oubliette, the Resourceful Rat utilized the Gungeon's ever changing layout to construct a maze to frustrate Gungeoneers seeking vengeance.

Studying ancient texts and third-hand accounts, the Hunter finally discovered the location of the relic. Unfortunately, she didn't know that the Blacksword organization had been following her, and had moved to recover the relic just before she could reach it.

Undeterred, the Hunter infiltrated their headquarters to steal it, and found the relic powering some occult machine. She was confronted and trapped by Dr. Wolfenclaw, who intended to have her cryogenically frozen and then experimented on. The Hunter managed to escape using mysterous technology, but was forced to fight one of Dr. Wolfenclaw's abominations. Displaying the ability of a warrior honed by lifetimes of battle, the hunter prevailed and escaped.

Had she not escaped there, she may have been frozen for millenia.

With great hubris, the Primerdyne science team opened a transdimensional portal. They were unprepared for what awaited them on the other side, however. Shortly after the rift was created, horrors spilled forth in legion. The security detail did their best to suppress the flow of darkness, but many were slain or driven mad with fear before they could close the portal.

Hearing the emergency klaxon ring through the station, the Marine emerged from his cell to find a trail of blood leading to the Science Lab. A more cowardly man might have fled to the escape pods, but the Marine joined his faltering squadmates and slew the demonic scourge. How he attained such courage, and prowess in battle, no one knows.

#RESOURCEFULRAT_AGD_LONGDESC_POSTKILL
This rat-creature never sought the Gungeon for its treasures, but instead found himself cast here upon the tides of fate.

When next the ship docked, he escaped and found himself alone on this planet. Here he wandered, until finally coming upon the Gungeon.

Stuck in its time loop, he made a nest and a name for himself while training daily. His martial prowess is undeniable, and in truth he likely possesses the skill to reach the Gun.

During his trials, however, he found his calling: being an ass to Gungeoneers. The Gun interests him not; in his eyes, he has no regrets, for he is King.
