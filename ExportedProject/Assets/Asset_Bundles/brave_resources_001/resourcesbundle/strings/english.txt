Thanks for avenging me!
#TUTKNIGHT_RUNBASEDMULTILINE_FOYER
Now that I've had my revenge, perhaps in time I can learn to forgive.
Revenge... it sure feels great!
Blockner and I used to argue all the time about proper defensive techniques!
After my death, I fell into a deep sadness for many years, thinking my dodging techniques were flawed.
I realized that to finally rest easily, I needed to know for certain. I needed to train a champion.
I began to doubt, until you arrived. You weren't the best student I ever taught, but then you found {wj}my shield{w}.
When you found my shield, I knew it was time. You could get my revenge.
All those years... all my teachings, finally validated.
Thank you again, my friend. You have truly mastered all I have to share.
It's funny, there have been way less new Gungeoneers since you showed up. Guess it's just a lull...
#TUTKNIGHT_RUNBASEDMULTILINE_STOPPER

You got Blockner! {wq}VENGEANCE IS MINE!{w}
You gave me my sweet revenge, and I'll never forget it.
I'm still trapped here, for {wj}all eternity.{w} But at least I have my revenge. And that is what is most important.
Maybe I'll follow you out this time.
Oh... I know! I'll donate {wq}this{w} to the Gungeon's Acquisitions Department for you.

Vigorous dodge roll, %PLAYER_NICK.
Save some for later.
Ok then.

An impasse! Use your dodge roll to jump over that pit.
#TUT_KNIGHT_R3_PLAYER_INTERACT_001
Approach the edge and press %CONTROL_DODGEROLL while moving to cross the gap.
You have to jump that crevice.
#TUT_KNIGHT_R3_PLAYER_CROSS_FIRST_PIT_001
Excellent! Meet me up ahead!
#TUT_KNIGHT_R3_PLAYER_ENTER_SECOND_ZONE_001
Keep going! You can do this!

#TUT_KNIGHT_R3_PLAYER_INTERACT_003
Go on through the door.

Ouch! Try pressing %CONTROL_DODGEROLL just as you reach the edge.
You'll get it.
Walked right in, didn't you?
Watch your step there, %PLAYER_NICK.
I can't watch this.
#TUT_KNIGHT_R3_PLAYER_FALLS_INTO_PIT_BY_DODGEROLLING_001
I think you dodge rolled too early there.
Wait till the last moment to hit %CONTROL_DODGEROLL.
Dodge roll when your feet are in the red.
#TUT_KNIGHT_R3_PLAYER_DODGEROLLS_NOT_OVER_PIT_001
Yes! Do that, only across the pit!
You're a natural roller. Use it to proceed!
Yes, very nice roll there.
Alright, alright. Settle down.

#TUT_KNIGHT_R4_DR_BACK_FROM_DEATH
Congratulations, you died in the tutorial. Not everyone can say the same.
#TUT_KNIGHT_R4_DR_EXPLANATION_001
This is the most important lesson: you can dodge roll by pressing %CONTROL_DODGEROLL and a direction.
#TUT_KNIGHT_R4_SPEAK_AGAIN
You are INVULNERABLE TO GUNFIRE during the FIRST HALF of the dodge roll, but vulnerable again when you hit the ground.
This means you can dodge THROUGH bullets and other hazards. It requires precise timing.
When you give the word, I'll open the barrier. Use the dodge roll to reach the right side of the room without {wq}perishing{w}.
Wait until the last second, then press %CONTROL_DODGEROLL to begin the roll. Are you ready to begin the test?
#TUT_KNIGHT_R4_DR_EXPLANATION_002
#TUT_KNIGHT_R4_HOW_TO_DODGE_ROLL
Press a direction and %CONTROL_DODGEROLL to dodge roll.

Nice work!
#TUT_KNIGHT_R4_D4_PLAYER_INTERACT_001
The DODGE ROLL is the prayer of the Gungeoneer, and the Gungeon provides for its devotees.
No one knows why this only works in the Gungeon, only that the Gungeon provides.
You must master the dodge roll if you wish to master the Gungeon.
Go to the next room for dodge roll lesson No. 2.
#TUT_KNIGHT_R4_D4_PLAYER_INTERACT_001_CONTROLLER
The DODGE ROLL is the prayer of the Gungeoneer, and the Gungeon provides for its devotees.
No one knows why this only works in the Gungeon, only that the Gungeon provides.
If you're using a controller, you can also dodge roll with %CONTROL_ALT_DODGEROLL .
You must master the dodge roll if you wish to master the Gungeon.
Go to the next room for dodge roll lesson No. 2.
#TUT_KNIGHT_R4_PLAYER_INTERACT_WHILE_BULLETS_ARE_ON_SCREEN
Use %CONTROL_DODGEROLL to dodge THROUGH the bullets.
Wait until they are just about to hit you.
Make it to the far side of the room, if you can!
#TUT_KNIGHT_R4_GOOD_DODGE
Perfect!
Yeah!
Too Pro!
#TUT_KNIGHT_R4_HIT_DURING_ROLL
Too early, wait 'til the last second.
Too early.
You are only invulnerable during the dodge.
#TUT_KNIGHT_R4_HIT_BEFORE_ROLL
Don't forget to dodge!
Dodge straight through!
ouch.
oof.
eep.
Er... keep at it.
Remember it's %CONTROL_DODGEROLL to dodge roll, right?
//----------------------------------Tutorial Room 004.5 blanks
#TUT_KNIGHT_BLANKS_FIRST_TALK
The dodge roll is the first and best way to avoid dying in a gunfight.
#TUT_KNIGHT_BLANKS_CONTINUED_01
Sometimes though, the number of bullets can be overwhelming.
For instance, there's no dodging through that. But there is a way to clear the path!
#TUT_KNIGHT_BLANKS_CONTINUED_02
These are called Blanks.
Using one will delete all enemy projectiles in a room, and stop enemies from shooting for a short period.
They will also push nearby enemies away. Great if you need a second to reposition.
Pick them up by walking over to them.
#TUT_KNIGHT_BLANKS_PICKTHEMUP
Grab a Blank!
Pick it up!
#TUT_KNIGHT_BLANKS_KEYBOARD_CONTROL
Use them by pressing the %CONTROL_USEBLANK button.
#TUT_KNIGHT_BLANKS_CONTROLLER_CONTROL
Use Blanks by clicking the %CONTROL_L_STICK_DOWN and %CONTROL_R_STICK_DOWN in at the same time.
#TUT_KNIGHT_BLANKS_USEONENOW
Use a Blank to clear the way of bullets, and then quickly make it through the gap!
#TUT_KNIGHT_BLANKS_KEYBOARD_CONTROL_REMINDER
Pop that Blank!
Use them by pressing the %CONTROL_USEBLANK button.
Use a Blank to clear these bullets!
#TUT_KNIGHT_BLANKS_CONTROLLER_CONTROL_REMINDER
Pop that Blank!
Click both %CONTROL_L_STICK_DOWN and %CONTROL_R_STICK_DOWN in at the same time to use a Blank!
Use a Blank to clear these bullets!
#TUT_KNIGHT_BLANKS_TOOSLOW
Blanks only stop bullets for a short amount of time. Try again.
One more!
Again!
#TUT_KNIGHT_BLANKS_DODGEROLL
Dodge rolling won't get you out of this one.
Part of mastering the dodge roll is knowing when not to use it.
Stop dodging and use a Blank.
#TUT_KNIGHT_BLANKS_TOOKDAMAGE
Try not to walk into the bullets.
Use a Blank!
ouch.
#TUT_KNIGHT_BLANKS_SUCCESS
Excellent!
Blanks refill every floor, so use them when you need to!
They can also be found throughout the Gungeon, but I wouldn't rely on that.
Onward!
#TUT_KNIGHT_BLANKS_EXTRA_TALK
The force of a blank can reveal and even break open false walls.
If you see a crack in the wall, use a blank to blast it open.
Head on through.
Go on.
Go!

Go on.
Move it.
#TUT_KNIGHT_TELEPORTER_FIRST_TALK_MEDKIT
You made it!
You know how to Dodge Roll, shoot, and use Blanks, but there's more to learn.
You need to know how to use items that don't exist in gun form.
This Medkit, for example! It will replenish your health.
#TUT_KNIGHT_TELEPORTER_FIRST_TALK_MEDKIT_USE_MEDKIT
Pick it by approaching it and hitting the %CONTROL_INTERACT button.
#TUT_KNIGHT_TELEPORTER_FIRST_TALK_MEDKIT_PICKITUP
Grab it!
Press %CONTROL_INTERACT near the Medkit to pick it up!
Pick up that Medkit!
Go pick that thing up!
#TUT_KNIGHT_TELEPORTER_FIRST_TALK_MEDKIT_PICKEDUP
Press the %CONTROL_USEITEM button to use it.
#TUT_KNIGHT_TELEPORTER_FIRST_TALK_MEDKIT_FULL_HEALTH
You've got plenty of health right now, so {wj}don't{w} use it yet.
But when you think you need it... jam the %CONTROL_USEITEM button to use it.
#TUT_KNIGHT_TELEPORTER_FIRST_TALK_MEDKIT_MID_HEALTH
You still have a bit of fight in you, so you might want to wait to use it.
Whatever you decide to do, remember that the %CONTROL_USEITEM button uses items.
#TUT_KNIGHT_TELEPORTER_FIRST_TALK_MEDKIT_LOW_HEALTH
You aren't looking so hot there. You should heal right away.
Press the %CONTROL_USEITEM button to use the Medkit and heal yourself!

#TUT_KNIGHT_R5_SHOOT_COME_BACK
Alright, I think you've got the hang of it. Come on back.
#TUT_KNIGHT_R5_SPAWN_ENEMY
Use the %CONTROL_AIM to aim and %CONTROL_FIRE to fire.
Reload with the %CONTROL_RELOAD button.
But first, you'll need something to shoot.
One of the Gungeon's natural inhabitants... cruel, savage, and bloodthirsty.
#TUT_KNIGHT_R5_SHOT_BY_PLAYER
You got me.
Whoosh.
You cannot harm me, for I have transcended the mortal coil.
It's not very effective...

Cold blooded. Truly, you are ruthless.
#TUT_KNIGHT_R5_GOOD_LUCK_FINAL
The next rooms will be real gunfights.
Kill all the enemies in each room, and the doors will open.
I'll meet you a few rooms ahead. Now go!
#TUT_KNIGHT_R5_PLAYER_INTERACT_AFTER_ROOM_COMPLETION
Don't forget you can reload with the %CONTROL_RELOAD button.
If you find another gun, you can switch to it with %CONTROL_QUICKSWITCHGUN.
Drop a gun by holding %CONTROL_SWITCHGUN_ALT.
The gun you start with has unlimited ammo, but the rest have a limit.
Try to keep the guns you like best stocked with ammo.
You can aim and move in opposite directions. Sometimes, you should!
#TUTORIAL_KNIGHT_GUNS_NOTE_01
Use %CONTROL_QUICKSWITCHGUN to switch guns. -Manny

#TUT_KNIGHT_TELEPORTER_FIRST_TALK
You see that thing on the other side? That's a Teleporter.
Whenever you find one, you can always return there as long as you aren't in combat.
#TUT_KNIGHT_TELEPORTER_EXPLANATION_CONTROLLER_001
To use it, first open the map by holding %CONTROL_MAP. Then select the %SYMBOL_TELEPORTER symbol you wish to warp to, and press %CONTROL_INTERACT to travel there.
Got it? Or should I explain it again?
#TUT_KNIGHT_TELEPORTER_EXPLANATION_KEYBOARD_001
To use it, first open the map by holding %CONTROL_MAP. Then click the %SYMBOL_TELEPORTER symbol you wish to warp to.
Got it? Or should I explain it again?
#TUT_KNIGHT_TELEPORTER_OK_THEN
Good. Now use the teleporter to cross the gap.
#PLAYER_TELEPORTER_RESPONSE_PLAYER_READY
Got it.
#PLAYER_TELEPORTER_RESPONSE_PLAYER_NOT_READY
One more time please!
#TUT_KNIGHT_TELEPORTER_EXPLANATION_OTHER_SIDE
Remember, you can warp to any Teleporter on the map, not just ones in the same room. But they won't work if you are in combat!
If you press %CONTROL_INTERACT while standing on that portal, you can use it to teleport back to where you were.
I'll be waiting a few rooms north of here. You should explore! Try to find a better gun before you challenge the {wj}BOSS{w}.
#TUT_KNIGHT_TELEPORTER_ANOTHER_QUESTION
Another question?
#PLAYER_TELEPORTER_RESPONSE_003
Why does the Teleporter look like that now?
#PLAYER_TELEPORTER_RESPONSE_004
Nope. I'm good.

Wait... that shield!
You found {wj}my shield{w}...
Which means... you know my {wq}terrible secret.{w}
IT'S TRUE! I never conquered the Gungeon! I'm no longer sure this even IS the Gungeon!
How humiliating! It's all that bastard's fault...
#TUT_KNIGHT_R7_SHIELD_PLAYER_RESPONSE_01
Whose fault?
#TUT_KNIGHT_R7_SHIELD_PLAYER_RESPONSE_02
I suspected as much. Bye.
#TUT_KNIGHT_R7_HASSHIELD_02
That snake Blockner! We were {wj}supposed{w} to be partners.
But shortly after we arrived, I was shot in the back.
When I awoke, I was trapped in some kind of... chest.
I called out for help, but no one came. I'm sure it was him who shot me.
I think he wanted the Gun for himself... but he must not have made it.
#TUT_KNIGHT_R7_HASSHIELD_02A
That snake Blockner.
#TUT_KNIGHT_R7_HASSHIELD_02B
We were going to loot this place, like old-fashioned adventurers.
Maybe even use the Gun to make some, er, choice bets.
But when I finally broke my way out of that chest, Blockner was long gone.
At night the walls shifted, and I found myself sealed in.
#TUT_KNIGHT_R7_SHIELD_PLAYER_RESPONSE_03
Neat story. I'm leaving.
#TUT_KNIGHT_R7_SHIELD_PLAYER_RESPONSE_04
How do you know he didn't make it?
#TUT_KNIGHT_R7_HASSHIELD_04
Because if Blockner had changed the past, he would never have come to the Gungeon, and neither would I.
But I'm still here. So he must have left...
Or maybe he's stuck in the Gungeon too. It would serve the bastard right.

Got it.

You want me to kill him?

Hey now! Nobody said anything about {wj}killing.{w}

Anyway, I've nothing left to teach you.
Good luck with the Gungeon and your past.
#TUT_KNIGHT_R7_HASSHIELD_07B
Well then. Anyway, I've nothing left to teach you. Steady aim, %PLAYER_NAME.
#TUT_KNIGHT_R7_HASSHIELD_08
That'll do. Go on.
You'll know Blockner if you meet him. He speaks in the olde style.
Leave me to my studies. The next time you face me, my power will be one-thousand fold.
Leave me.
#TUT_KNIGHT_R7_HASSHIELD_09
That'll do. Go on.
You'll know Blockner if see him, he wears a suit of armor, in the colors red & black.
Leave me to my studies. The next time you face me, my power will be one-thousand fold.
Leave me.

If I hadn't been betrayed by that turncloak, I wouldn't have ended up here!

Ok, I'll bite. Who are you talking about.

Still not interested, grampa.

Not yet.
In a moment.
I wasn't ready.
Come here if you want a fight!

Come on!
Save some of those bullets for Blockner.
Fire-y aren't you.

#RIVAL_MANY_TAKEPLAYERDAMAGE_BEFORE_AGGRO
Sucker shot!? I like thy style.
Once more and I shalt quarrel!
#RIVAL_FIRST_TALK_01
Hail friend, and well met! 
What brings you to this gun-dungeon?
#RIVAL_FIRST_RESPONSE_01
Looking for the GUN, same as everyone.
#RIVAL_FIRST_RESPONSE_02
You know why I'm here.
#RIVAL_SECOND_TALK_01
Oh. That's a relief!
...I mean, of course you are.
We abandoned that quest not long after our fool of an assistant ran afoul of some bullets.
See you around, adventurer.
#RIVAL_ALT_TALK_01
Is there something else?
#RIVAL_ALT_RESPONSE_01
Nope.
#RIVAL_ALT_RESPONSE_02
Yeah, I'm here for YOU!
#RIVAL_ALT_TALK_02
On your way then, adventurer.
#RIVAL_SECOND_TALK_02
Eh... I'm not quite certain what you mean!
You must be here to kill your past, correct?
#RIVAL_SECOND_RESPONSE_01
Manny says "Hi."
#RIVAL_SECOND_RESPONSE_02
I'm kidding!
#RIVAL_THIRD_TALK_01
Oh, whew... rather, of course you are!
Why wouldn't you be kidding?
Ah ha ha ha.
#RIVAL_THIRD_TALK_02
Ah... I see.
You understand I won't just roll over, right?
#RIVAL_FINAL_RESPONSE
I do.
#RIVAL_RUN_AWAY
Well then...
Look out behind you!
#RIVAL_FINAL_TALK
It seems my past has caught up with me.
Time to {wj}Kill it!{w}
#RIVAL_KILLED_01
Aw, nuts. 
Bested by a disciple of Manny...
{wq}Humiliating!{w}
I guess there really was something to that "dodge roll" he was always on about.
What I don't understand is why the bullets don't hit you. It really looks like they should.
I guess... I'll head back to the Breach.
#RIVAL_FOYER_FIRST
Manny! It's been so long! You haven't... uh... changed a bit!
You always were pretty pale.
...
//-----TODO write some more here if you want- maybe flesh the story out a bit
#RIVAL_RUNBASEDMULTILINE_FOYER
I guess I should thank you for taking pity on Manny. But I won't.
What's a bit of revenge killing between friends?
Death doesn't seem to mean a whole lot here, though.
Trapped here for all of eternity.
I guess this isn't so different from before, when I was alive but trapped here for all of eternity.
The other dungeons me and Manny used to loot never had any guns. It was always sharp metal.
Maybe now I can finally learn to roll.

Well, what do we have here? You must be a new arrival.
Let me guess. Here to change the past, right? Well, you're not the first.
But there's no salvation here.
I was like you once, came to change the past.
And now I have no future...
Heh heh heh heh...
#CRESTFALLEN_INTERACT_003
Well, since you're here... Let me help you out.
Before you go in, you'll probably want to talk with Manny.
He's just through this door here.
He'll... give you a tour...
So, off you go. It is why you came, isn't it? To this accursed temple?
Hah hah hah hah...
#CRESTFALLEN_INTERACT_004
Oh, have you seen that misguided spirit?
...Ser Manuel. 
He's stuck in those halls, lost. Sad, really.
Hah hah...
#CRESTFALLEN_INTERACT_005
Strange, how this places changes, and changes people.
That bird was here before the great Bullet struck...
He's no one's pet now...
Heh heh...

Ah, so you've bested the great eye.
Don't get too hopeful, though. There are more and worse monsters yet below.
Heh heh heh...
#CRESTFALLEN_INTERACT_BASHELLISK
That great serpent had claimed the lives of many.
Another will certainly rise... from the shells of others.
But... well done, in the interim...
Heh heh heh...
#CRESTFALLEN_INTERACT_DOORMIMIC
A strange beast, that one.
Appearing as the door... Did it trick you?
Hah hah... 
#CRESTFALLEN_INTERACT_GORGUN
...the Gorgun. You've met her.
And killed her, it seems. Did she turn your trigger finger to stone?
#CRESTFALLEN_INTERACT_BULLETKING
The King has been dethroned... should I call you my liege?
Heh heh heh...
#CRESTFALLEN_INTERACT_BULLETBROS
Those two ruffians... the Gundead toughs.
Did they put up much of a fight?

The Gundead have reclaimed it all... that Tank included. 
A long time ago, they tried to take this place by force.
But enjoy your success. You deserve exactly that...
Hah hah...
#CRESTFALLEN_INTERACT_POWDERSKULL

You've been deep in the mines. 
Fought the Great Skull, then, have you?
Everything in here eventually dies, but the bones remain.
I wouldn't think too hard about it, though.
...
#CRESTFALLEN_INTERACT_DEMONWALL
The infernal barricade has fallen. 
Little stands in your way, now, adventurer...
...but what little remains, even fewer have bested.
I wouldn't worry, though.
You can always... try again.
Heh heh...
#CRESTFALLEN_INTERACT_STATUES
Four ancient statues for four dead bullets.
...and now even their statues have been ground to dust.
Tell me... at the end.
Did you see her?
I can see in your eyes that you did.
Know this: she is behind much of this.
#CRESTFALLEN_INTERACT_OLDKING
...the Dead King. 
You've ended his reign for good, and now have glimpsed the Forge with your own eyes.
Not many can say the same.
...do you feel proud?
Heh...
#CRESTFALLEN_INTERACT_BLOBULORD
Oh, so you've bested the great slime lord.
It has been quite some time since any ventured into those depths.
...did you find anything else of note, down in the oubliette?
Heh heh...
#CRESTFALLEN_INTERACT_BLOCKNER
Ser Manuel has rejoined us, I see.
...and... his insufferable friend.
#CRESTFALLEN_INTERACT_BUNKER
The Gundead have grown quite industrious.
To be organized enough to occupy that bunker...
...well, it's interesting, don't you think?
Hah...
#CRESTFALLEN_INTERACT_DRAGUN
What? You've slain a great beast, deep in the Forge...?
... Could it be true?
... no. You must be lying.
#CRESTFALLEN_INTERACT_LICH

Why return to me, over and over?
Why torment me like this?
What is there in this place left for you?
Please... just leave me.

Didn't manage it this time, either, eh?
Well, they're no different from the rest, then.

Or maybe you've something else left to do...

I don't know why you're even trying.
Shouldn't you just give up?
Why not just... stay here and drink?
What keeps you going like this...?
You won't be able to change anything. No one can, really.

How's the mapping coming along?
#LOSTADVENTURER_QUEST_NOT_COMPLETE
Oh, looks like there's still a bit more to explore.
#LOSTADVENTURER_QUEST_RESPONSE_A
<Share the completed map>
#LOSTADVENTURER_QUEST_RESPONSE_B
<Don't share the completed map>
#LOSTADVENTURER_QUEST_COMPLETE
Thank you! You should take this. A strange old man gave it to me!
#LOSTADVENTURER_CORE_COMPLETE
Hey listen, I want to thank you for all your help.
Speak with me in the Breach. I've got something for you.
For now, though, you should take this.
#LOSTADVENTURER_ADVCORE_COMPLETE
You've really gotten me out of some tight spots, huh?
Let's meet up in the Breach soon. I think I have something you'll like!
For now, though, you should take this.
#LOSTADVENTURER_CORE_COMPLETE_ACHIEVEMENT_OFFER
Hey pal! I've got something for you!
I want you to have my favorite weapon. It's seen me through a lot of dungeons over the years.
I donated it to the Acquisitions Department for you.
Now that I'm a bit more experienced, I don't think it'll be too dangerous on my own.
Good luck!
#LOSTADVENTURER_ADVCORE_COMPLETE_REWARD
Welcome back! 
We've been wandering some pretty rough spots, lately. I found something down there, but I think you'll put it to better use than me.
See you next time, friend.
#LOSTADVENTURER_MAP_DENIED
You jerk!
What!? Why?
#LOSTADVENTURER_OUTRO_QUESTION
Thanks again. How can I help?
Everything alright?
So, how's your run going?
Is this... {wq}the run{w}?
#LOSTADVENTURER_INFO_QUESTION
Why are you down here?
#LOSTADVENTURER_SMALL_CHAT
Are you going to be okay?
#LOSTADVENTURER_INFO_CASTLE
Usually I have to go through several other dungeons before I get to a Castle.
#LOSTADVENTURER_INFO_GUNGEON
I dropped a small key down a grate and came down here to get it.
#LOSTADVENTURER_INFO_MINES
I came down here looking for some rocks to blow up. There's usually grottoes!
#LOSTADVENTURER_INFO_CATACOMBS
I got into a race with a gravedigger and ended up here.
If only I had some heavy boots, I wouldn't slip on this ice!
#LOSTADVENTURER_INFO_FORGE
This place reminds me of someone I used to know. Big fella.
#LOSTADVENTURER_INFO_HELL
What did I do to end up here?
I've taken a very, very wrong turn.
#LOSTADVENTURER_INFO_SEWER
Ugh, why would anyone bother coming down here.
I found a crest, but it looked too fragile to carry.
#LOSTADVENTURER_INFO_CATHEDRAL
Thanks for opening the door to get down here. Now do you know how to get out?
#LOSTADVENTURER_INFO_GENERIC
Not all those who wander are lost, my friend. I, however, am very lost.
#LOSTADVENTURER_OUTRO
I can definitely find my way, now. No doubt about it at all!
#LOSTADVENTURER_SHOOT
Nope.
That doesn't work on me.
That isn't very heroic.
#LOSTADVENTURER_STEAL
Hey, those are mine!
Hands off, %PLAYER_NICK !
Hey, Listen! ...stop that.
#LOSTADVENTURER_POTBREAK
There's nothing in those pots. I already checked.
Budget Dungeon, nothing in the pots. Why even have them?
#LOSTADVENTURER_RUNBASEDMULTILINE_FOYER_GENERIC
Thankfully, the Breach doesn't shift around like the rest of the Gungeon.
I'm studying the maps to see if I can figure out some kind of pattern.
Occasionally, I'll find scraps of maps made by other people.
I think I found something interesting. Some notes scribbled on the margins of an old adventurer's journal.
It looks like there may be a fireplace, with a switch behind the fire.
Maybe the switch does something important.
I think I found the fireplace in Chamber 1. I couldn't put the fire out though.
Huh.
Have you seen the tomb in Chamber 2? There's that altar...
I wonder if that altar does something.
The old maps I find are never accurate, though.
#LOSTADVENTURER_RUNBASEDMULTILINE_FOYER_STOPPER
Hmm...
I have to think about this. Let's talk later.
//-----------------------------------------ledge goblin / helmet goblin
#GOBLIN_JAILED_INTRO
Wow! Thanks for rescuing me!
I'm heading back to the Breach.
We'll see each other again, I'm sure of it.
#GOBLIN_DUNGEON_FIRST_EXPLANATION
Thanks for letting me out again. I guess.
As you can see, I got my helmet back.
Let's not... have any more accidents, okay?
#GOBLIN_DUNGEON_SECOND_EXPLANATION
I found it. Again.
I don't know why you did that, but please don't do it again.
Now I just need to find my way out...
#GOBLIN_DUNGEON_THIRD_EXPLANATION
Okay, I get it. 
You're just a jerk. That's the only explanation.
I keep having to get my helmet, and wind up here, locked up.
And then you just let me out, so you can kick the helmet again!
This is madness!
#GOBLIN_DUNGEON_OUTRO
I guess I'll see you later.
Later.
#GOBLIN_A_FIRST_01
You're new.
#GOBLIN_A_DISTRESS_01

#GOBLIN_A_ANNOYED_01

#GOBLIN_B_FIRST_01
Everything... back to normal. Whew.
#GOBLIN_B_DISTRESS_01
No! What? Why?
Again? REALLY?
#GOBLIN_B_ANNOYED_01
I {wq}really{w} don't want to talk to you right now.
#GOBLIN_C_FIRST_01
Well, here we are again.
#GOBLIN_C_DISTRESS_01
Yep. There it is.
You are the worst.
#GOBLIN_C_ANNOYED_01
It isn't even a surprise any more.
#GOBLIN_GOTO_FOYER
Talk to me in the Breach next time you are there. And watch your damn feet.
#GOBLIN_D_FIRST_01
You know, before you started kicking my helmet into that pit,
I had long since given up on getting out of this place.
But, now that {wj}you've{w} come to the Gungeon, I know I have to get the hell out of here.
So, regardless of your intentions, thank you for rejuvenating my ambition.
I've ordered something from the Gungeon Acquisitions Department. Hopefully it will come in handy.
If you find it down there, feel free to use it.
It's not like you have any respect for personal property anyway.
Now leave.
#GOBLIN_D_IDLE_01
We're not friends, though. Go on.
#GOBLIN_D_DISTRESS_01
Ha! Ha ha! 
Not this time, sucker.
#GOBLIN_RUNBASEDMULTILINE_FOYER_GENERIC
You know, I didn't even come here on purpose.
I had heard the stories... but how could something like this be real?
I was scouting, and I flew too close.
I was flying straight, but then suddenly I was back several miles.
At first I thought the instruments were busted.
Eventually I realized the ground kept skipping back. Surreal.
When I landed, I found this place.
I couldn't believe it. Die in this horrible place over and over, or eventually succeed and reverse time?
Eventually, I realized it had to be true.
So I challenged the Gungeon, hoping to never get trapped in its time loop. Over and over. Eventually I got sealed in.
And then you came... and now I'm here.
{wq}Hmm mmm mm mmmm. Hmm hmmmm hmmm.{w}
#GOBLIN_RUNBASEDMULTILINE_FOYER_STOPPER

...another time.

Insult to injury, huh?

#BLACKSMITH_FIRST_INTERACTION_01
It's been a very long time since anyone has come down here.
Come to "kill" your past? You've made it further than most, that's certain.
#BLACKSMITH_FIRST_INTERACTION_02
If you thought it was going to be that easy, I've got some bad news for you.
#BLACKSMITH_INITIAL_EXPLANATION_A
What do you mean?
#BLACKSMITH_INITIAL_EXPLANATION_B
I know everything I need to know.
#BLACKSMITH_INITIAL_EXPLANATION_01
The Gun that kills the past... like everything else, it needs ammunition.
Otherwise... well, what stopped time here... that's old magic.
If you find the Gun, it may fire, but how far back will you go?
You might just find yourself right back here again.
You want to get out of this place, and change something about your past, right?
To tear a hole that far back, you'll need a {wj}special bullet.{w}
I can make it for you... but the materials might prove hard to find.
#BLACKSMITH_EXPLANATION_DECLINED_01
Suit yourself.
#BLACKSMITH_SECONDARY_EXPLANATION_A
Tell me what you need.
#BLACKSMITH_SECONDARY_EXPLANATION_B
Who are you? And how do you know this?
#BLACKSMITH_INITIAL_IDENTITY_EXPLANATION_01
I'm just a gunsmith, but I've had a very long time to figure this out.
...you aren't the first to come this far, either.
#BLACKSMITH_PRELIST_FIRST_TIME
To make the bullet, I'll need...
#BLACKSMITH_PRELIST
Let me see... what did I need from you again...?
#BLACKSMITH_SHARED_ELEMENT_01
The Prime Primer, lost in the upper Chambers
#BLACKSMITH_SHARED_ELEMENT_02
Some Arcane Gunpowder, mined in the heart of the Gungeon
#BLACKSMITH_SHARED_ELEMENT_03
A shard of Planar Lead, broken off from the Great Bullet when it struck
#BLACKSMITH_SHARED_ELEMENT_04
An Obsidian Shell casing, bored from the tooth of a great beast
#BLACKSMITH_INITIAL_CLOSURE_01
Bring all of that to me, over many lifetimes... and I will aid you in your quest.
#BLACKSMITH_REPEAT_WELCOME_01
You're back.
#BLACKSMITH_REPEAT_A
I have something for you.
#BLACKSMITH_HAVENOTHING_LEAVE
Bye.
#BLACKSMITH_TOTAL_WASTE_OF_TIME
No, you don't.
#BLACKSMITH_ASK_FOR_SPECIFIC
I see you brought me the %NPCREPLACEMENT.
#BLACKSMITH_BROUGHT_SOMETHING_TWICE
I already have the %NPCREPLACEMENT.
#BLACKSMITH_GIVE_ITEM

#BLACKSMITH_DONT_GIVE_ITEM
No, I can't give it to you yet.
#BLACKSMITH_GIVEN_ITEM
Thank you.
#BLACKSMITH_DENIED_ITEM
Alright.
Okay, then.
That's fine, there's still some time.
I guess you think you have all the time in the world.
#BLACKSMITH_THANKS_STILL_NEED_MORE
The bullet still requires more materials.
#BLACKSMITH_DENIED_ITEM_GOODBYE
If you want to kill your past, you'll need to let things go.
#BLACKSMITH_COOPCULTIST_GO_AWAY_01
I don't have time to play games, kid. Go pick up your darts.
#BLACKSMITH_RECEIVED_EVERYTHING_01
That's everything... I must say I'm impressed.
It's been a long time since I've made a bullet like this one.
And, you brought enough for several bullets. If you fail, just come back another time...
//---this line should unlock the achievement

Why are you here?

Here's the bullet.

#BLACKSMITH_BULLET_PT2_FOR_CONVICT
Hey... and try not to get caught this time.
#BLACKSMITH_BULLET_PT2_FOR_MARINE
Give 'em hell, soldier. Heh.
#BLACKSMITH_BULLET_PT2_FOR_HUNTER
You're going back a long ways, aren't you? Aim well.
#BLACKSMITH_IDENTITY_EXPLANATION_01
I was hired, long ago, to make guns for the one who built this place.
A powerful wizard, that one, and fascinated by firearms. But... he needed a smith.
He was always experimenting with them, infusing them with magic. 
Where others walked with a staff, he strode with a strap.
I think he was worried that guns would make the magics of the old world obsolete.
In that way, I guess he was right...
Then the great bullet hit, and neither I nor my sister ever saw him again.
#BLACKSMITH_IDENTITY_EXPLANATION_02
It wasn't too long before others came to investigate what had happened.
They quickly realized that visiting this place was a permanent decision.
Some people got out early, when the Planar Lead was abundant, and before the Gundead took hold of this place.
#BLACKSMITH_IDENTITY_EXPLANATION_03
The ones who got out spread the word, and the legend of the Gungeon was born.
A second chance, right wrongs, riches, fame... a thousand reasons to risk your life.
Must have been a tempting proposition, to those that heard the tale. Or at least to those who believed it.
#BLACKSMITH_IDENTITY_EXPLANATION_04
We still aren't sure {wq}why{w} the Bullet struck, or where it came from. 
All I know for sure is, it was {wj}that{w} Gun he was working on when it happened.
#BLACKSMITH_IDENTITY_EXPLANATION_05
My sister traded for new guns. New artifacts for him to study.
She's able to get things from outside the Gungeon, sometimes...
And I had this forge, so I got to work.
#BLACKSMITH_IDENTITY_EXPLANATION_06
If I could undo anything...? 
It would be to stop the Bullet from ever being fired.
And then I'd never step foot in here.
But that's impossible, I think. Without the Bullet, there would never have been the Gun.
For us who knew this place before, the power of the Gun is hollow. Oh well...
//------------------------Blacksmith Runbased Multiline

Hello, again. Need something done?
Welcome back. Few make it this far, and even fewer return so often!
Got a few guns, eh? I probably worked on a few of them.
Hello! Forge, I can. Strong, I am! Hehe, just kidding.
Growing up here was strange, but I had my sister to look after.
#BLACKSMITH_RUNBASED_MULTILINE_STOPPER

That's enough chatter for now.
I've got to concentrate on this.

#BLACKSMITH_ARM_PICKUP
Oh, right! That arm. I made it for Ox, to replace the one he lost.
I've been meaning to take that back to the Breach... but I'm always so busy.
If you bring it to Cadence and Ox, I'd appreciate it. I'm sure they would too.
That is, if you can figure out some way to get it back up...
#BLACKSMITH_ARM_PICKUP_AGAIN
If you get that arm to Cadence, I'm sure she'll be grateful.

It fell down the shaft though, so who knows where it might turn up. Maybe you'll find it!
I wonder what else is hidden in these shafts...
#SHERPA_BOSSRUSH_ELEVATOR_UNLOCK
You really are amazing.
Since you helped me out with the elevators, I thought I might do something extra for you.
I skimmed some resources off the top of what you gave me, and I made a special elevator.

Hey! Thanks for getting us out of that cell.
This is the Gungeon Acquisitions Department.
You can donate %META_CURRENCY_SYMBOL, and we'll order new guns and items for the collection.
It can be hard to come by here in the Gungeon, but since the H-mon took over, that's all anyone on the outside uses.
#METASHOP_CADENCE_BREACH_INITIAL_PLAYERRESPONSE_A
Collection?
#METASHOP_CADENCE_BREACH_INITIAL_PLAYERRESPONSE_B
Neat.
#METASHOP_CADENCE_BREACH_INITIAL_02
Yeah the Gungeon is like, a reliquary, or some kind of museum... only for guns.
So we are collecting all the best ones, and then throwing them downstairs.
Luckily, the H-mon has to put rebels down pretty regularly, so we've got a constant supply of new equipment. They'll sell us anything!
#METASHOP_CADENCE_BREACH_INITIAL_03
Once they're ordered, you can find the new stuff down in the Chambers.
So order whatever you want. If you've ordered everything we have listed, just come back later.

Watch out for all the bullets.
Use the teleporter to come back and spend some more!
Blobulons get faster when they split apart. Weird ones, those. Not native to the Gungeon, either.
Rubber Bullets won't hurt you, but they sure are annoying!
Shotgun Kin can be dangerous if they back you into a corner.
Some Gunjurors can catch your bullets and fire them back at you. Time your shots well.
You're either dodgin' or you're dyin' down here.
Spend some %CURRENCY_SYMBOL.
If you get hit, lay on the ground and die.
The Map is helpful, given you know how to read one. Never figured it out myself. That's why I run this shop.
If you completely run out of ammo, switch to the gun you brought with you. It's crap, but it doesn't quit.
The Gungeon is a mystical place. Some say it's never the same twice. I say that all the time.
We don't ask each other what we're here for in the Gungeon. Keep your questions to yourself.
The Items I sell do all sorts of things. I have no idea, really.
If you find a crack in a wall, use a Blank to blast it down.
If you don't have a Key, you can try and bust a chest open. The loot you find might not be as good.
My cat Ocelot came with me to the Gungeon. Guess she's got her own demons to battle.
People come from all over the galaxy to the Gungeon. Most of us never leave.
Have a seat on one of my masterfully crafted stools!
Gundead are belligerent by nature, so show them no mercy!
Folks tell of a great one-eyed beast with a score of arms and a gun for each one. Wouldn't want to run into him!
I sell Guns, Items, Hearts, Keys and Armor. Pretty much cornered the market on them too.
Reloading takes time, so watch your ammo bar!
Nobody knows why bullets pass through you while you're rolling in the Gungeon, but at this point I've stopped questioning it.

But maybe... I've got a plan. And it's just crazy enough to work!

I have left something here for you. Good hunting, adventurer.

I can't do this any more. I'm just going to lay down my arms, here... and die.

Just gotta wait for Mauser to get back. Don't know what I'd do in this situation without him around.

Wrong gun, I guess. I'll leave it here.
#SECRET_NOTE_02
Too much to carry. Making a note of this spot on my map, so I can come back later.
#SECRET_NOTE_03
If I stay here long enough, the walls should shift...

Eventually, it'll put me right in the exit! Genius!
#SECRET_NOTE_04
I don't like the way the Gundead look at me, with those soulless eyes... so low on their head.

I think I'll just stay here for a bit.

Sure, you probably could've given me one of those fancy guns you've been hoarding.
But the point is, this ain't your fault.

Even though it has lost much of its {wq}great power{w}...
It is said that it can {wq}reflect{w} the magic of that dark wizard...

The {wr}bullet{w}... person.
The spell is almost complete. Soon, my QuickDraw master rises.
All bullet kin will be slaves to his {wr}grandeur{w}.
To be fired by {wq}HIS WILL!{w}
I have learned from your undead master, but I am {wq}not{w} his kind!

...no, I have to have courage. I must defeat this evil. I must!
#BULLET_PAST_COMPLETE_TEXT_01
With Agunim's defeat, ballistic mayhem returned to the Gungeon, and the Evil King Cannon's influence began to fade. 
The Kin returned once more to their flipped tables, the Gunjurers danced their arcane dances, and all was well.
But what became of the nameless hero Kin...? 
...that is another story.

#POOP_RUNBASEDMULTILINE_GENERIC
If you don't see me, kill some time in the Gungeon. I'll roll back by eventually.
I roll my shop around. Here, there, any way the wind blows.
My store is number 1, never number 2!
I left my home town when it was destroyed by a horrible green bug, sporting a 90's 'tude.
Have you met Bello? He runs the shop in the Gungeon. I quite admire his stools.
My goods are always duty-free!

That creeping specter... something familiar about him.

I met the strangest faceted gentleman atwixt the Breach's columnwork. 
I found his ideas most amusing!

I decided to go back in for some action. Sorry if I gave you trouble.
#CRESTFALLEN_INTERACT_PHANTOM_BLOCKNER

#SHRINE_BLOOD_DISPLAY
An ominous fountain, filled with blood. You're so thirsty...
#SHRINE_BLOOD_ACCEPT
Drink. <Regain health>
#TONIC_FIRST_INTRO
Ever feel like things are a little slow around here?
Ever feel like rolling around at the speed of sound?
#TONIC_INTRO
Want to go fast?
#TONIC_ACCEPT
Radical!
#TONIC_DECLINE
I think everything is fast enough, thanks.
#TONIC_ACCEPTED
Ah, yeah! This is happening!
#TONIC_DECLINED
You're too slow!
#TONIC_ACTIVE_INTRO
How's it going, speedster?
#TONIC_ACTIVE_ACCEPT
Can you slow things down again?
#TONIC_ACTIVE_DECLINE
Just wanted to chat.
#TONIC_ACTIVE_ACCEPTED
No problem.
#TONIC_RUNBASED_MULTILINE_GENERIC
I'm a chilly dog.
You haven't run into my nemesis, Nick, have you? He's a robot. Old robot Nick, we always called him. He's a doctor.
I have to say, this Gun Zone is a lot darker than the last place. 
I think I preferred the casino.
#TONIC_RUNBASED_MULTILINE_STOPPER
Better get going.
#TONIC_JAIL_RESCUE
Oh hey, buddy!
You set me free!
I never thought I would escape from this cell.
Anyway, I'm Tonic.
Tonic the Sledge-dog.
Look for me up in the Breach if you ever want to go a little faster.
#TONIC_JAIL_REPEAT
Be seein' you.
#TONIC_DAMAGED
Not so fast!
Zing!
#SYNERGRACE_MEET_IN_CELL
. . .
...it's been quite some time since I've seen anyone down here.
Well!
Thanks very much for letting me out of this dreary place!
Once I get a little bit of my strength back, I should be able to help you out quite a bit.
I'm sure I'll be seeing you soon!
#SYNERGRACE_CELL_SECOND_TALK
Oh, I'm not much for big gatherings. I'll stay down here.
But we'll see each other from time to time, I'd think.
#SYNERGRACE_CELL_REPEAT
See you again soon!
#SYNERGRACE_INTRO
Well!
Great to see you again, adventurer! Having a nice Gungeon? Getting plenty to eat?
I see you've got quite the collection, there.
But... your equipment lacks something. Missing a little... gun ne sais quoi.
I can help with that. Sometimes a piece of kit doesn't truly shine until it finds the right partner!
#SYNERGRACE_OFFER
Let's see...
I think I've got the perfect match for you! 
What do you say? Are you feeling it?
#SYNERGRACE_CANT_MATCH
Let's see...
Oh, my. It seems like all your stuff is happy just as it is!
#SYNERGRACE_ACCEPT
Sure! <Pay %NPCNUMBER1%CURRENCY_SYMBOL>
#SYNERGRACE_ACCEPTED
Let's hook you up, then!
Let's see if love really can bloom on the battlefield!
Let's make a match!
#SYNERGRACE_POSTMAGIC
A perfect match. That'll really get your gear humming!
#SYNERGRACE_REJECT
I'm just fine, thanks.
#SYNERGRACE_REJECTED
Well. Got ice in your veins, or what?
#SYNERGRACE_NOMONEY
Well, good matchmaking isn't free, you know?
#SYNERGRACE_DAMAGED
It's not very wise to anger a sorceress, you know.
Don't point that at me!
#SYNERGRACE_CHAT
Have you met Trorc? Nice guy, though a bit lonely. Has a thing for helmets.
Seems like more and more strange items are showing up in the Gungeon. Really makes my job harder, you know?
It'd be nice to visit the Breach, but it's getting pretty crowded! I guess remodeling it would be a lot of work, though. Who would even do it?
#SYNERGRACE_CHAT_STOPPER
See you next time!
#MONSTERMANUEL_FIRST_TIME
For it is I, Monster Manuel!
Heed my words and I shall show you how to survive this accursed labyrinth.
...just kidding!
Since you cleared up that ugly business with Blockner, I've started to make my way through the Gungeon!
#MONSTERMANUEL_OTHER_TIMES
If it isn't my finest pupil! 
#MONSTERMANUEL_GIVE_ITEM
I found this while traversing the depths. Perhaps you'll find it useful!
#MONSTERMANUEL_REPEAT_DUNGEON
It seems sometimes the best move is {wq}not{w} to dodge roll... though such cases are rare.
I've known you were something special ever since you killed that defenseless bullet, completely in cold blood, in the Halls of Knowledge.
Do not be afraid of my fearsome visage! This is merely my disguise, a beast of yore, the owl-barrel.
In recent days, I've heard tell of a new type of dodging... "sliding," they call it. I find it difficult to imagine.
#MONSTERMANUEL_REPEAT_DUNGEON_BLOCKER
Thanks to you, only one task remains for me... vengeance upon the Gungeon.
#MONSTERMANUEL_DAMAGED
Nay!
Another betrayal!
#MONSTERMANUEL_FOYER
Fear not my terrifying disguise! It is I, your mentor and friend, Manuel!
I am preparing for my next descent into the Gungeon.
#SHRINE_BEHOLSTER_DISPLAY
A shrine to the evil eye, the sphere of many guns: the Beholster.
It appears each arm of the shrine could hold a weapon.
#SHRINE_BEHOLSTER_ACCEPT
<Place the gun on the statue>
#SHRINE_COMPANION_DISPLAY
A statue commemorating the few friendly faces encountered deep in the Gungeon.

Though the ground nearby is bloody, your heart is filled with joy.
#SHRINE_COMPANION_ACCEPT
<Offer your heart to a new friend>
#DRAGUNFIRE_CULTIST_INTRO
Welcome, fellow acolyte!
It appears that Gun Cult fashion has changed substantially since our forefathers were sealed into this holy chamber.
Be at peace, for inside the chest before you...
...lies the fabled Gun That Can Kill The Past!
Your long pilgrimage is finally at an end. Join us in eternal worship!
Prostrate thyself!
#DRAGUNFIRE_CULTIST_AFTER_REVEAL
Our holy relic... a simple gun that {wq}cannot{w] kill the past?
It can't be...
#DRAGUNFIRE_CULTIST_REPEAT_INTRO
Welcome back, iconoclast!
Even though our worship has been shown to be nothing but a paltry insult, we are too set in our ways to change.
#DRAGUNFIRE_CULTIST_CHAT
It seems that bullets have gotten a lot larger since we were sealed in here.
#DRAGUNFIRE_CULTIST_STOPPER
Praise the Gun!
#RESOURCEFULRAT_CONSOLATION_NOTE_01
You made it through two rounds, but you couldn't go the distance.

Have a consolation prize, %INSULT! -R.R.
#RESOURCEFULRAT_CONSOLATION_NOTE_02
What a shame, %PLAYER_NICK! 

Maybe you'll get me next time, but you probably won't. -R.R.
#RESOURCEFULRAT_CONSOLATION_NOTE_03
Nothing without your guns, are you, %PLAYER_NICK?

Try again. -R.R.
#RESOURCEFULRAT_DEATHBED_COME_HERE
Come hither, %PLAYER_NICK.
#RESOURCEFULRAT_LIFESTORY_01
Pity me, for my story is a tragedy.
I was born in the hold of a tradesman's ship, where my mischief made our nest among the refuse.
When the tradesman changed routes, the food they previously hauled was replaced with weaponry.
I watched my brothers and sisters starve, though I vowed to protect them.
So I learned to steal, from the captain's personal stores. It was sadly... not enough.
My efforts to feed them only prolonged their suffering. I couldn't steal enough; it became an obsession.
I knew that the end was coming. Eventually, driven mad with hunger, my mischief turned on each other.
The weakest went first, but soon, the last of my kin were gone, eaten by their brethren.
When the trader finally docked, I escaped his ship... and found myself here, trapped in time.
I have clawed a home here from nothing. My own kingdom.
But here I lie, cut down by a usurper with the pettiest of intent. Revenge? You do not know pain..
I have one last thing to ask...
Take off your mask, so that I may see your face with my own eyes.
...
Oh.
That's... actually your face.
Ha! I realize now...
It seems... 
I never knew...
True tragedy.
#RESOURCEFULRAT_DEATHBED_DAMAGED
Have mercy!
Yield!
Let me tell you my life's story, damnit!
#CRESTFALLEN_INTERACT_FUSELIER
...you encountered some sort of great bomb?
Stranger and stranger beasts appear below, these days.
The Gungeon grows... volatile.
Heh...
#CRESTFALLEN_INTERACT_HIGHDRAGUN
What's this?
The great Gungeoneer returns triumphant again, and deigns to speak to me?
Have you grown tired of everyone else in this forsaken place falling over themselves to help you?
Or have you simply grown accustomed to the punishment?
How many times now have you changed your past...
...and found yourself missing this place?
#BABYDRAGUN_UNFED
A long-imprisoned serpent. It looks hungry.
#BABYDRAGUN_FED_ONCE
Though the creature looks stronger, it is still too weak to move.
It appears that the serpent could go for seconds.
#RATMIMIC_ENCOUNTER
Hey, I know we kind of had a deal goin', but...
...honestly, there's just too many chests in here.
Gungeon Mimic Union's spread a bit too thin at the moment. Lot of irons in the fire.
And frankly, the chests in here just aren't up to code. Can't deal with ‘em.
#RATMIMIC_CHAT
Who built these things? Everyone knows Gungeon chests use metric.
Gotta charge a different rate for these chests anyway. Oversize units.
#RATMIMIC_STOPPER
You got a problem?
#VAMPIRE_THRESHOLD
Hey! I didn't invite you in!
#VAMPIRE_INTRO_RESCUE
Greetings, young one.
No need to be afraid; I'm not a member of the Gundead.
No, just regular old undead here.
You have my thanks for granting me freedom.
I have crossed... oceans of time, to find this place. I am hoping that my efforts will prove... fruitful.
#VAMPIRE_INTRO_STOPPER
There's too much light leak in the Breach. I'll stay down here.
#VAMPIRE_DAMAGED
Bleh!
Blah!
Bleh, bleh!
#VAMPIRE_OFFER
You seem to have more than enough %HEART_SYMBOL to get by.
Enough, perhaps... to share? I'll reward you handsomely.
#VAMPIRE_NOHEARTS
It seems that you thirst as much as I. Come back when you are feeling more robust.
#VAMPIRE_ACCEPT
Sure...? <Receive %NPCNUMBER1%CURRENCY_SYMBOL>
#VAMPIRE_DECLINE
Wow, no thanks.
#VAMPIRE_PLAYER_HAS_ACCEPTED
The blood is the life... and now it's mine! Take your metal.
Oh, how I hunger eternal for {wq}living blood{w}! Thank you kindly.
#VAMPIRE_PLAYER_HAS_DECLINED
Oh, don't be so negative. Be positive!
#VAMPIRE_RUNBASED_MULTILINE
I really sunk my teeth into medicine, but my efforts were in vain.
Fangs for trading!
It's high stakes out there. If you're not using those %HEART_SYMBOL, I need to unload some silver.
Life sucks, then you're jammed.
Gungeoneers don't bleed as much as you'd expect, given all the bullets.
I'm also a werewolf! It's true.
We've all become the Gun's madmen... all of us.
Do you believe in destiny? That even the powers of time can be altered for a single purpose? The luckiest alive is the one who finds... the Gun.
#VAMPIRE_RUNBASED_MULTILINE_STOPPER
Are you trying to bleed me dry? Go from whence you came.
#POOP_AGD_NEWSTUFF
Hey! I found a bunch of new weird crap you can buy! Pinch me off some of that sweet %META_CURRENCY_SYMBOL!
#CRESTFALLEN_INTERACT_RESOURCEFULRAT_NEW
Did you visit an old friend, deep beneath the mines?
That bothersome rat...
He took much from you, I see. Did you repay him in kind?
...I must admit, few will shed a tear for him.
#RATFIGHTINTRO_FOUND_ME
You finally made it! Pretty sharp.
Did you enjoy my maze? Fufufufufufufu!
#RATFIGHTINTRO_FOUND_ZERO_NOTES
What!? How did you find me?
You are either exceedingly lucky or some kind of hacker!
#RATFIGHTINTRO_3_OR_LESS_NOTES_01
Hmmm. It's statistically unlikely that you got here reading so few notes. I think you might have cheated... but I can't be sure. So I'll just have to kill you!
#RATFIGHTINTRO_3_OR_LESS_NOTES_02
Are you brute-forcing your way through my immaculately designed maze? That makes me angry! DIE!
#RATFIGHTINTRO_3_OR_LESS_NOTES_03
Go appreciate my poetry! You aren't supposed to be here yet! Grawr!
#RATFIGHTINTRO_4_NOTES
Here with only 4 notes... how resourceful. But there can only be one! Die, usurper!
#RATFIGHTINTRO_5_NOTES
Here you are. I can't blame you for getting impatient... who wouldn't want a slice of this?
#RATFIGHTINTRO_6_NOTES_ATTEMPT_001
You have wedged yourself in here, but now you're trapped like a rat!
You've been grating my nerves since you got here.
But now you'll face me: The Big Cheese!
#RATFIGHTINTRO_6_NOTES_ATTEMPT_002
You followed the trail of cheese through the maze! Congratulations! Here's your reward! Fufufufufufufu.
#RATFIGHTINTRO_REPEATED_ATTEMPTS
Back with your tail between your legs, I see. I'll make you full of holes... again! Fufufufufu.
Your tenacity is remarkable. It will be your end!
Something stinks... oh, it's you again.
#RATFIGHTINTRO_START_POSTVICTORY
I was just getting warmed up before, now I'll melt you!
It seems we were destined to do this over and over again! Die, usurper!

Have you heard of the Gungeoneer, Theodore of Ras?
He was known for his alacrity, but faltered with the eyes of the galaxy upon him.
So beloved was he that he was granted a second chance, a new life with which to challenge the Gungeon.
And yet, again he fell.
Today, I'm drinking to him. Poor bastard.

#BLACKSMITH_RUBY_GIVE
Sure, it's worthless anyway. <Give %BRACELETRED_ENCNAME>
#BLACKSMITH_RUBY_REFUSE
No. I am attached to it.
#BLACKSMITH_RUBY_ACCEPTED
Thanks.
...
This thing. I made it when I was first starting out.
I hate it.
It reminds me of failure.
I'm going to fix it.
...make it better.
#BLACKSMITH_RUBY_RETURNED_ON_THIS_ACTION
...
Ok.
It is better. Different at least.
Here you go.
I never want to see it again.
#BLACKSMITH_RUBY_REFUSED
...
#BLACKSMITH_RUBY_REFUSED_OR_REPEAT
Give. It. To. Me.
Why are you being like this? Give me that trinket.

I'll send you to bullet hell!
#AGUNIM_VO_FIGHT_LOSE_01
Not enough firepower, it seems...
#AGUNIM_VO_FIGHT_LOSE_02
Mastered by your own slow reflexes.
#AGUNIM_VO_FIGHT_LOSE_03
Next time, try dodge rolling.
Here's an idea... next time, try dodge rolling.
#AGUNIM_VO_FIGHT_LOSE_04
My master shall return!
#AGUNIM_VO_FIGHT_LOSE_05
You missed your shot!
Oh, so sad... you missed your shot!
#AGUNIM_VO_FIGHT_LOSE_07
The gun is mine!
#AGUNIM_VO_FIGHT_COOP_01
What is this child you have brought with you?
#AGUNIM_VO_FIGHT_COOP_02
Your very presence insults me, child.
#AGUNIM_VO_FIGHT_SHADOW_01
I'm a shadow!
#AGUNIM_VO_FIGHT_ATTACK_01
Take this!
#AGUNIM_VO_FIGHT_HURT_03
Nice shot!
#AGUNIM_VO_FIGHT_ATTACK_02
I'll kill you, then my past!
#AGUNIM_VO_FIGHT_ATTACK_03
Die!
#AGUNIM_VO_FIGHT_ATTACK_04
You bothersome insect!
#AGUNIM_VO_FIGHT_WIN_01
Forgive me, master!
#AGUNIM_VO_FIGHT_WIN_03
You'll regret this...
#AGUNIM_VO_FIGHT_WIN_04
I got all the bad guns...
#AGUNIM_VO_FIGHT_WIN_05
You got all the good guns!
#AGUNIM_VO_NPC_VENDOR_02
Oh... it's you.
